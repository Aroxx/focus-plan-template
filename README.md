# Focus / Goal Planning Templates

Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, and Weekly outlines for planning goals / areas of focus. These were taken from [The Way of the SEAL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1621454037) by Mark Divine. Buy the book and check out his work at [SEALFIT.com](https://sealfit.com).

I originally started using these templates in an OPML format but the latest versions of OSX don't play well with OPML Editors so I've switched to Markdown.
